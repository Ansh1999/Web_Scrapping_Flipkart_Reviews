4,macbook air,Shudhanshu shukla,5,Highly recommended,"The best you can get, looks and performance both are to notch, supreme battery life, ultra fast speed. Display and sounds are fantastic, never seen any better till now.

8,macbook air,Biswajit basak,5,Classy product,"Migrated from 2016 MacBook Air. Brand new, sealed pack product, authentic product was delivered by Flipkart. Transition from old laptop was very smooth. Best in class Laptop. Super happy with the Retina Screen, new speaker system, butterfly smooth key board, long battery life. Only thing that could have helped more is one USB port, I had to buy an USB type C to Type A extender separately."

After full charge I used it for 2 days (more than 16 hrs) still more than 20% charge remaining. Best and suitable for high end users like coder/IT persons.
