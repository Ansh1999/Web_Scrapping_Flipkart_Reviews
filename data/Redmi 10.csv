3,redmi 10,Sumit banerjee,3,Decent product,Extremely Big phone with average build quality. Does not have the classy feeling that Note 7S I had earlier. Plastic back. Worst Selfie Camera within recent years from Xiaomi. Decent Back Camera which can give good pictures with minor tweaks in settings.

8,redmi 10,Pravin awate,4,Bad quality,Camera is very poor. Pictures taken with its 50mp camera are as good as 8 mp camera of any mobile. Front camera also is not good at all. Call recording is not available. Battery take lot of time to charge. Charger is of very average quality. Needed to provide 33W fast charger but it's 10W slow charger.
9,redmi 10,Dipankar roy,4,Value-for-money,"Camera quality could be better, there is only 2 back camera but design is look like quad camera.There must a soft case expected with in this budget.Batter and other performance is good.Android 12 is really missing here hope fully it will upgrade soon.It is mono speaker, sound quality is ok.Batter back-up is good, but it is taking longer time as only 10watt charger provided, for fast charging we need to purchase 18W charger."
